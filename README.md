# OpenTraceLab Website & Documentation

Welcome to the **OpenTraceLab** documentation repository.  
This repo contains the sources for the OpenTraceLab website and user/developer documentation, built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

OpenTraceLab is an open-source ecosystem for logic analysis, based on a fork of the [sigrok](https://sigrok.org) project.  
It consists of:

- **OpenTraceCapture** ‚Äì the capture engine and device backends (fork of sigrok)  
- **OpenTraceView** ‚Äì the graphical user interface for visualizing signals (fork of OpenTraceView)  
- **OpenTraceDecode** ‚Äì protocol decoders (fork of sigrok-decode)  

This repo provides **end-user documentation, developer guides, and community information** for the whole OpenTraceLab ecosystem.

## üìñ Documentation

### Local Development

Start local server while writing:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs serve
```

Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000 to preview.

### Publishing Versions

**First version publish (manual):**

```bash
# Build and publish version 1.0, set 'latest' alias, make default:
mike deploy 1.0 latest
mike set-default latest
git push origin gh-pages
```

**After adopting tag-based CI, just create a tag:**

```bash
git tag v1.1
git push origin v1.1
```

The workflow will run and publish 1.1 as a new version + update latest.

See [Material's versioning docs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-versioning/) and [mike documentation](https://github.com/jimporter/mike) for reference.
