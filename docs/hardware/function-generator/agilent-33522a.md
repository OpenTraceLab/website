## Connectivity \- Front: \- USB-A socket for storage devices \- Back: \- USB-B socket \- Ethernet \- GPIB (optional) ## Communication protocol The device is controlled using SCPI command strings, among them some IEEE-488 common commands like "\\*IDN?". All commands and their respective functions are specified in the "Operating and Service Guide", which applies for all devices in the 33500 series. ## TODO \- Which USB endpoint must be used to communicate with the device? \- Does the ethernet interface use UDP or TCP? \- Which ports are being used? The website suggests 5024 or 5025. ## Ressources \- Website: <https://www.keysight.com/en/pd-1871286-pn-33522A/function-arbitrary-waveform-generator-30-mhz> \- Datasheet: <https://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5990-5914EN.pdf> \- Operating and Service Guide: <https://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/33500-90901.pdf>
