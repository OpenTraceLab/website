The **BitScope BS10** is a mixed signal oscilloscope and logic analyzer. It is part of the [BitScope series](http://www.bitscope.com/product/) of devices, sometimes referred to as the **mini**. Up to 8 logic channels and up to 2 analog channels support samplerates up to 40MSa/s, and share the sample memory with a total size of 12KiB. Which translates to sample counts of 4K up to 12K depending on the number and type of enabled channels. The analog channels and the upper logic channels can be used at the same time in the BS10 model  (other devices share hardware between channels, and don't allow concurrent use of them all at the same time).

All BitScope devices are said to support a common physical transport and VM programming model, the design of which was [published](http://bitscope.com/download/files/CircuitCellar.pdf) in [Circuit Cellar](http://circuitcellar.com/). The individual devices' feature set and how to control it differs between models. It is yet to be seen whether one common sigrok driver can support several of these models. Currently none of the BitScope devices are supported.

See [BitScope BS10/Info](https://sigrok.org/wiki/BitScope_BS10/Info) for USB details about the device.

Many thanks to the vendor, [BitScope Designs](http://www.bitscope.com/), for providing us with sample hardware. Their product range is very open, with all protocol information and even hardware schematics freely available. This exemplary vendor support helps us implement sigrok drivers more quickly.

2022-03-15 Status Update: The completeness and correctness of the protocol documentation, as well as its applicability to current firmware versions found in real world devices, is yet to get verified. Several different protocol versions appear to exist, so that the specific subset of the overall protocol which is supported by a given device is yet to get determined.

## Hardware

The device operates with [Microchip dsPIC33FJ128-GP804](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/dsPIC33FJ128GP804)
which connects to the computer via an
[FTDI FT245RL](http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/ICs/FT245R.htm) (USB to parallel FIFO interface).

The typical host connection is a USB based serial port. Tunneling of this serial communication via TCP is an option.
