As it's a gateware project that can be used on different FPGA's, the sample speed, number of channels and sample memory is configurable. Communications between the FPGA and the PC is done via a UART connection at 115200 BAUD. UART to USB conversion depends on FPGA hardware used.

## Hardware As sola is gateware, it can be used on most FPGA's. ## Software tools TODO ## Photos TODO ## Protocol The protocol between the FPGA and the PC is based on the ["extended SUMP" protocol](Openbench_Logic_Sniffer.html#Protocol "Openbench Logic Sniffer") with changes to work with more than 32 channels. The SUMP protocol has short commands, that are exactly one byte long, and long commands, that are 5 bytes long. The long commands's first byte is the opcode, the other 4 bytes are the payload. For example, the Set Trigger Mask command has the opcode 0xC0 and 4 bytes for the trigger values, 1 bit per channel. This approach only works for 32 channels or less. sola can be configured for 32 or multiples of 32 channels. When configured for more then 32 channels, all long commands are extended. For 64 channels, all long commands are 9 bytes long, for 96, all long commands are 13 bytes long et cetera. When a command does not need extra bytes for the channels, the extra bytes are set to 0x00. For example, a long command when configured for 32 channels: [![\1](../../assets/hardware/general/\2)](./File:SolaLongCommand32.svg.html) The same command when configured for 64 channels: [![\1](../../assets/hardware/general/\2)](./File:SolaLongCommand64.svg.html) ## Resources TODO
