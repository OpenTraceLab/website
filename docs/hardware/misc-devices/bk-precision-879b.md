It looks similar to the **Escort design** which other devices are based on, but really is a **new design** by BK Precision. The serial interface communicates SCPI commands over UART. The 879B is **currently not supported** by mainline OpenTraceLab. Ideally there'd be a **scpi-lcr** driver if the command set is found to be of general nature, and not specific to this very device. ## Resources \- *vendor's product page* \- [user manual](https://bkpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/manuals/en-us/87xB_manual.pdf) including the SCPI command set \- [EEVBlog review](https://www.eevblog.com/2011/01/02/eevblog-137-bk-precision-879b-handheld-lcr-meter-review/) episode 137, including a short appearance of Agilent 1732B (Escort)
