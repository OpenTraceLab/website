## Nightly APK builds You can download and install the experimental *OpenTraceView* nightly build APK: \- [OpenTraceView-NIGHTLY.apk (ARM)](http://OpenTraceLab.org/jenkins/job/OpenTraceLab-cross-android/platform=cross-arm-linux-androideabi/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/OpenTraceView-NIGHTLY.apk) The APK ships *OpenTraceView* for Android including all required libraries, protocol decoders, and so on. ### Firmware files In order for *OpenTraceCapture*/*OpenTraceView* to be able to find *firmware files* for certain devices, you have to copy them to the following location: /sdcard/OpenTraceLab-firmware Please check *OpenTraceCapture*'s [README.devices](http://github.com/OpenTraceLab/?p=OpenTraceCapture.git;a=blob;f=README.devices) file or the respective wiki page to find out whether your device needs firmware files. ### Issues Please check the [list of known Android related issues](http://OpenTraceLab.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?list_id=2259&query_format=advanced&resolution=---&op_sys=Android). If you have specific issues which are not listed yet, please [open a bug report](http://OpenTraceLab.org/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi) and attach the relevant information, e.g. which device you used, which architecture (ARM/x86/MIPS/etc), the relevant parts of the adb log, and so on. ## Building from source You can also build various OpenTraceLab components from source. The nightly APK (see above) is built using the [OpenTraceLab-cross-android](http://github.com/OpenTraceLab/?p=OpenTraceLab-util.git;a=blob;f=cross-compile/android/OpenTraceLab-cross-android) script from our [OpenTraceLab-util repository](http://github.com/OpenTraceLab/?p=OpenTraceLab-util.git;a=tree;f=cross-compile/android). You can use that script to build your own APK locally (and/or modify it if you want). $ git clone git://OpenTraceLab.org/OpenTraceLab-util $ cd OpenTraceLab-util/cross-compile/android The following invocation will install the required Android NDK, SDK, and toolchains into **\$HOME/android** (per default). Please check the [README](http://github.com/OpenTraceLab/?p=OpenTraceLab-util.git;a=blob;f=cross-compile/android/README) and modify the [OpenTraceLab-cross-android](http://github.com/OpenTraceLab/?p=OpenTraceLab-util.git;a=blob;f=cross-compile/android/OpenTraceLab-cross-android) script to your needs. $ ./OpenTraceLab-cross-android prepare Then, in order to build the APK, you can run: $ ./OpenTraceLab-cross-android The file **build/OpenTraceView/android/bin/OpenTraceView-debug.apk** is the APK that you can install on your Android device. ## Manual testing Create a temporary folder where you can store and execute files on your Android device. $ adb shell $ mkdir /data/local/tmp/OpenTraceLab $ exit Copy libraries to your device: $ cd ~/sr_android/lib $ ls *.so* | while read l; do adb push $l /data/local/tmp/OpenTraceLab; done Copy **OpenTraceCLI** to the device: $ cd ~/sr_android/bin $ adb push OpenTraceCLI /data/local/tmp/OpenTraceLab Test if **OpenTraceCLI** is working as expected: $ adb shell $ cd /data/local/tmp/OpenTraceLab $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/local/tmp/OpenTraceLab $ ./OpenTraceCLI --scan
