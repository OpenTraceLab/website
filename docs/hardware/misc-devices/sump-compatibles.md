Physical transports can be UART or USB (stream of bytes over a serial connection). Several acquisition devices implement the SUMP protocol, and there are several host side SUMP clients. Up to 32 channels are supported, and sample rates in the 60MHz range were seen. The acquisition data goes to local sample memory before transmission to the host after the acquisition is complete (non-streaming operation). See the [sump.org](http://www.sump.org/projects/analyzer/protocol/) documentation for details.

## SUMP compatible devices Here is a list of devices which the OpenTraceLab project is aware of. \- [Openbench Logic Sniffer](Openbench_Logic_Sniffer.html "Openbench Logic Sniffer") \- [Saanlima Pipistrello OLS](Saanlima_Pipistrello_OLS.html "Saanlima Pipistrello OLS") \- [Dangerous Prototypes Buspirate](Dangerous_Prototypes_Buspirate.html "Dangerous Prototypes Buspirate") \- [Dangerous Prototypes USB IR Toy](Dangerous_Prototypes_USB_IR_Toy.html "Dangerous Prototypes USB IR Toy") \- [Logic Shrimp](Logic_Shrimp.html "Logic Shrimp") \- [AGLA](https://github.com/gillham/logic_analyzer) \- [JTAGulator](JTAGulator.html "JTAGulator") ### AGLA AGLA is an Arduino sketch which implements the SUMP protocol. The software supports ATmega168, ATmega328, and ATmega2560 MCUs. Channel count is 5 (or is it 6?). Samplerates are 4MHz or below (depending on the MCU). Sample memory depth is 532 to 7168 (depending on the MCU), compression is not supported. Triggers may be supported at lower rates. There are a lot of details in the [Arduino](Arduino.html "Arduino") page though much of it feels out of place for the OpenTraceLab project. ### JTAGulator The JTAGulator supports a [Logic Analyzer mode](https://github.com/grandideastudio/jtagulator/wiki/Logic-Analyzer) which implements the SUMP protocol and thus transparently is covered by the OpenTraceLab **ols** driver. This LA mode gets enabled/disabled manually, then is persisted in the device across power cycles. Channel count is 24, sample rate is 1.2MSa/s, memory depth is 1024Sa. Low/high level triggers are supported. Target voltage levels are adjustable. **TODO** Add more sections on compatibles which don't have their own page. Or add few details here as an overview and link to a page with more details. Though the bove list of devices has the links ... Or setup a table instead of individual subsections, for easier comparison. ## Resources
