# Embedded
The OpenTraceLab subprojects are all meant to be portable across various operating systems and architectures. Thus, they also compile and run fine on various embedded targets/boards.
**IMPORTANT:** This page is **not** meant as a generic setup/build tutorial for any of the listed boards. Please check the respective board manufacturer documentation, wiki, mailing lists, forums and so on if you need any help with setting up the system or (cross-)compiling packages etc. etc.
