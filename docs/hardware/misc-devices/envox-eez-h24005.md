EEZ H24005 is [no longer under active development](https://www.crowdsupply.com/envox/eez-h24005/updates/the-h24005-is-dead-long-live-the-bb3) and the official kits are no longer available for puchase; its successor is the *EEZ Bench Box 3*. (The hardware designs are still available if you want to build one yourself from raw parts.)

## Hardware Due to being an open hardware design, there is comprehensive documentation of all of the hardware on [the project website](https://www.envox.eu/bench-power-supply/introduction/), including a [Technology overview](https://www.envox.eu/bench-power-supply/technology-overview/). The system is designed to be modular, so it can in principle have different power supply implementations and other custom modifications. A driver for this device should thus ideally be implemented in a dynamic way that can, as far as possible, respond to a particular system's different capabilities. ## Protocol The EEZ H24005 has a SCPI-based protocol available either over USB Serial or over TCP/IP on the device's Ethernet port. The project website has [a comprehensive guide to the SCPI implementation](https://www.envox.eu/bench-power-supply/psu-scpi-reference-manual/). The SCPI self-identification strings (from `*IDN?`) changed in firmware v1.02: \- Before v1.02: `EEZ,PSU 2/40/5` followed by the platform name \- v1.02 and later: `Envox,EEZ H24005` followed by the platform name Only the newer form is shown in the documentation. There is [an online simulator](https://www.envox.hr/eez-psu-simulator/) which allows exercising both the touch user interface and the SCPI port. The simulator is an emscripten build of a variant of the real system firmware, so its behavior is pretty realistic aside from (of course) having just a software model of the power supply module behavior. ## OpenTraceLab Support The OpenTraceLab `scpi-pps` driver supports the EEZ H24005, *User:Apparentlymart* provided the implementation. Only the USB port can be used to communicate with the device. The firmware's implementation of TCP over the ethernet port is broken. ## See also \- *Programmable power supply* \- *Power supply comparison*
