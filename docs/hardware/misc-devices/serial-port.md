# Serial Port

Serial ports are a common way to communicate with devices. The most common serial ports, as used by devices like Metex/Voltcraft multimeters, are RS232 interfaces.

## USB to serial converters To operate devices that have RS232 or TTL serial interfaces on computers that have only USB interfaces, converters are available. Many different chipsets exist that have slightly different properties, often supporting only a subset of what common UARTs like the 8250/16550A can do. Please note that a chipset-specific driver for the respective operating system is required (sometimes included in the OS already, e.g. mostly for Linux). Chipset and driver need to be seen as a union. The problems with some chipsets mostly seem to be more related to the quality of the driver than that of the hardware. Many original USB cables from OEM manufacturers use these converters, too, either with the chip manufacturer's or a custom USB ID. Most of the USB to serial converter chipsets deliver 3.3V or 5V TTL level signals and an additional converter chip between signal levels usually called a *Line Driver/Receiver*, e.g. a [Maxim MAX232](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAX232), is required to interface to a RS232 or other interface that uses different signal levels. The RS232 standard allows quite a huge span of 3 to 15V resp. -3 to -15V for the two signal levels. Some RS232 devices won't work on USB-RS232 converters because these converters tend to be at the lower end of these voltages and the devices need a higher RS232 signal voltage to work, e.g. to drive optocouplers in the interface. Sometimes a device might work on a converter of type A and won't on a converter of type B, depending on the chips used and other parameters chosen by the manufacturer. ## USB to serial converter chipsets Manufacturer | Type | USB | Data Bits | Custom baud | Baud min. | max. | Modem | Drivers | Homepage | Remarks

1 In October 2014 FTDI published Windows drivers version 2.11.0 and 2.12.0.0 that will check for fake FTDI chips. If these drivers suspect a chip to be a fake, they will overwrite the USB manufacturer and device ID of the device to 0, effectively [bricking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_\(electronics\)) the device. Installation of these driver versions (that were distributed via Windows Update automatically for some time) is strongly discouraged! See [EEVblog #676](http://www.eevblog.com/2014/10/27/eevblog-676-rant-ftdi-bricking-counterfeit-chips/) or [#FTDIgate](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FTDIGate) for further information. 2 The CP2102 and CP2103 offer aliasing a standard baud rate to a non-standard baud rate by using the manufacturer's customization tool.  Modem: Not all USB to serial converters support all lines used for modem status and hardware handshake. 6 means that RTS, CTS, DTR, DSR, DCD, and RI are present. 4 means that RTS, CTS, DTR, DSR are present, 2 means RTS, CTS only. The list above tries to include all manufacturers of such converter chips. It does not include all variants because some manufacturers have over 100! Many USB devices that use a custom USB identity are based on these chips, too. Most manufacturers offer tools that allow setting USB properties like Vendor ID, Product ID, Product Description String, Power Descriptor, Device Release Number and Device Serial number. ## Common serial to RS232 line driver/receiver chipset manufacturers \- [Analog Devices](http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/data_sheets/ADM222_232A_242.pdf) \- [Maxim](http://para.maximintegrated.com/results.mvp?fam=rs232) \- [Texas Instruments](http://www.ti.com/product/sn75lv4737a) \- [ZyWyn](http://www.zywyn.com/) ## USB to HID converter chipsets These devices are based on the USB HID device class and have no serial interface/RS232 emulation at the USB protocol level. But the chips implement access to the RS232 protocol, and communicate control and data by means of USB HID reports.  Manufacturer | Type | USB | Drivers | Homepage | Remarks

The serial communication layer of OpenTraceCapture transparently supports most of the above HID chips. Those which are not supported by the serial layer can be supported by specific device drivers (Victor DMMs). ## See also \- [Device cables](Device_cables.html "Device cables") \- [Multimeter ICs](Multimeter_ICs.html "Multimeter ICs")
