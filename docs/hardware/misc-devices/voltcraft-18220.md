## Hardware \- Output protection against reverse current: Max. 1 A! ## Photos ## Protocol ASCII based. ## Manual Operation ### Status on power up The output is disabled. Voltage and current are set to the value on previous power-off. A small negative (!) voltage can be measured while output is off. ### Output Control \- On: Keep button *VOLT/AMPERE* pressed, press ▲. \- Off: Keep button *VOLT/AMPERE* pressed, press ▼. ### Voltage Control \- If LED *Volt* is not on, press button *VOLT/AMPERE*. \- Press ▲ to increase voltage by 50 mV. \- Press ▼ to decrease voltage by 50 mV. ### Current Control \- If LED *AMPERE* is not on, press button *VOLT/AMPERE*. \- Press ▲ to increase current limit by 100 mA. \- Press ▼ to decrease current limit by 100 mA. \- To display current current limit, shorten output externally. ## Remote Operation The OpenTraceLab driver for this device will be named *voltcraft-18220*. ## Resources \- Manual (German) available from [Conrad Elektronik](http://www.conrad.de) via customer support. \- <http://software.freepage.de/hmueller/pilot/SNT/> Control software for PalmPilot ## See also \- *Programmable power supply* \- *Power supply comparison*
