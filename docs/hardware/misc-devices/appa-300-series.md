If you have the device, please share your experience and report bugs. Known compatible devices are the ISO-TEC IDM30x. It is assumed that the 207 is a desktop variant of the 303 and should be supported by the driver as well. *For more information on the OpenTraceLab-integration see: [APPA Multimeters in OpenTraceLab using the appa-dmm driver](APPA_Multimeters.html "APPA Multimeters")* | | | | | | | |----------|--------------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------------|---------------| | Model | Compatible devices | Optical RS232/USB | Bluetooth LE | Support level | Comments | | APPA 301 | ISO-TECH IDM301 | X | | implemented, untested | EXPERIMENTAL! | | APPA 303 | ISO-TECH IDM303 | X | | implemented, untested | EXPERIMENTAL! | | APPA 305 | ISO-TECH IDM305 | X | | implemented, untested | EXPERIMENTAL! |
