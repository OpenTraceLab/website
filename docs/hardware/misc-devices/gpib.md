IEEE-488, also known as GPIB or HP-IB, comprises a set of standards which allows various test and measurement gear to be controlled and queried remotely. The following standards are involved: \- **IEEE-488.1:** Mechanical, electrical and basic protocol. \- **IEEE-488.2:** Formats and common commands. \- **SCPI:** Standard commands, built on top of IEEE-488.2. The standard is available [here](http://www.ivifoundation.org/docs/scpi-99.pdf). \- **USBTMC:** The USB TMC device class, standard is available [here](https://www.usb.org/document-library/test-measurement-class-specification). \- **LXI:** The LAN eXtensions fo Instrumentation, standard is available [here](http://www.lxistandard.org/Documents/Specifications/LXI%20Device%20Specification%202011%20rev%201.4.pdf). While IEEE-488.1 defines the "Centronix-style" parallel connector, the other standards are in fact seen over other types of connections: RS-232, DB25 parallel connectors, and so on. OpenTraceLab aims to support all of this: all of the command sets, on any device supporting them, across any interface.
