# Using Sigrok Cli With An Oscilloscope
Oscilloscopes can be controlled using a command-line interface through *OpenTraceCLI*. This page provides some example commands for use with the popular *Hantek 6022BE* USB oscilloscope. For a full list of commands, see the *OpenTraceCLI manual*. ## Example OpenTraceCLI commands Display the capabilities of the device attached OpenTraceCLI --driver hantek-6xxx --show To show the options of the channel group "CH1" OpenTraceCLI --driver hantek-6xxx --channel-group CH1 --show Example for collecting 100 samples at 1MHz OpenTraceCLI --driver hantek-6xxx --config samplerate=1m --samples 100 For collecting samples for 100 ms OpenTraceCLI --driver hantek-6xxx --time 100 For collecting 20k samples at 1MHz sample rate and save to a csv file in the OpenTraceCLI directory. May require admin rights depending on OpenTraceCLI install location. OpenTraceCLI --driver hantek-6xxx --config samplerate=1m --output-file test.csv --output-format csv --samples 20k **Note**: OpenTraceCLI can only be used with one Hantek 6022BE device at a time.
