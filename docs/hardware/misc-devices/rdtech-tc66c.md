This device is similar to the *RDTech UM series* of devices, but doesn't use the same protocol.

## Protocol (CDC serial) | | | | | |---------|--------|------------|----------------------------------------------| | Command | Mode | Resp. len. | Meaning | | query | All | 4 | Query mode ('firm' or 'boot') | | getva | Normal | 192 | Poll readings. (ret: pacX) | | gtrec | Normal | Variable | Get recording. | | lastp | Normal | 0 | Previous page. | | nextp | Normal | 0 | Next page. | | rotat | Normal | 0 | Rotate screen. | | update | Boot | 5 | Prepare to upload firmware. Returns 'uprdy'. | ## Protocol (Bluetooth LE) ### Transport | | | |--------------------------------------|--------------| | UUID | What | | 0000ffe5-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb | TX service | | 0000ffe9-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb | TX attribute | | 0000ffe0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb | RX service | | 0000ffe4-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb | RX attribute | Transmission to the device is implemented by writing to the TX attribute in the TX service. RX is implemented by listening for notifications from the RX attribute in the RX service. ### Commands | | | | |------------|------------|----------------| | Command | Resp. len. | Meaning | | bgetva\r\n | 192 | Poll readings. | | blastp\r\n | 0 | Previous page. | | bnextp\r\n | 0 | Next page. | | brotat\r\n | 0 | Rotate screen. | Notice the leading 'b' in the Bluetooth case. The remainder appears to match the USB CDC case. ## Protocol response format ("Poll data") Poll data is returned as 3x 64 byte blocks of data, a total of 192 bytes. Each block is prefixed by `pacX` with X as 1, 2, or 3. The returned data is encrypted using AES in ECB mode. All integers are little endian. ### pac1 | | | | |--------|-----------|---------------------------------------| | Offset | Type | Meaning | | 0 | char\\[4\\] | `pac1` | | 4 | char\\[4\\] | Product name (`TC66`) | | 8 | char\\[4\\] | Version (e.g., `1.14`) | | 12 | uint32_t | Module serial number | | 16-43 | Unknown | Unknown | | 44 | uint32_t | Number of runs | | 48 | uint32_t | Voltage (multiply by 1e-4 for Volt) | | 52 | uint32_t | Current (multiply by 1e-5 for Ampere) | | 56 | uint32_t | Power (multiply by 1e-4 for Watt) | | 60-63 | uint32_t | Checksum | ### pac2 | | | | |--------|-----------|----------------------------------------| | Offset | Type | Meaning | | 0 | char\\[4\\] | `pac2` | | 4 | uint32_t | Resistance (multiply by 1e-2 for Ohm) | | 8 | uint32_t | Group 0 mAh | | 12 | uint32_t | Group 0 mWh | | 16 | uint32_t | Group 1 mAh | | 20 | uint32_t | Group 1 mWh | | 24 | uint32_t | Temperature sign (1 for negative) | | 28 | uint32_t | Temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit) | | 32 | uint32_t | D+ Voltage (multiply by 1e-2 for Volt) | | 36 | uint32_t | D- Voltage (multiply by 1e-2 for Volt) | | 40-59 | Unknown | Always zero? | | 60-63 | uint32_t | Checksum | ### pac3 | | | | |--------|-----------|--------------| | Offset | Type | Meaning | | 0 | char\\[4\\] | `pac3` | | 4-59 | Unknown | Always zero? | | 60-63 | uint32_t | Checksum | ### Checksum algorithm Checksums are implemented using CRC-16/MODBUS zero-extended to fit a 32-bit field. ### Encryption algorithm Poll packets are encrypted using AES in ECB mode using the following static key: 0x58, 0x21, 0xfa, 0x56, 0x01, 0xb2, 0xf0, 0x26, 0x87, 0xff, 0x12, 0x04, 0x62, 0x2a, 0x4f, 0xb0, 0x86, 0xf4, 0x02, 0x60, 0x81, 0x6f, 0x9a, 0x0b, 0xa7, 0xf1, 0x06, 0x61, 0x9a, 0xb8, 0x72, 0x88, Kudos to Ben V. Brown (see *\\#Resources*) for documenting the encryption algorithm and key. ## Recording format (gtrec) Recordings dumped using the `gtrec` command are returned as a list of 32-bit unsigned integer pairs terminated by `reck`. The first value in the pair is the voltage (multiply by 1e-4 to get voltage) and the second value is the current (multiply by 1e-5 to get Ampere). ## Firmware update Firmware update process: \- Issue a `query` command to verify that the boot loader is active. \- Issue the `update` command, wait for `uprdy`. \- Write firmware in blocks of 64 bytes (the last block may be shorter than 64 bytes). Each block is acknowledged with an `OK` response. \- Device reboots automatically. ## Resources \- the [Ben V.
