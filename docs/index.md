# OpenTraceLab
OpenTraceLab is an open-source ecosystem for logic analysis, based on a fork of the [sigrok](https://sigrok.org) project.
## Components
- **[OpenTraceCapture](opentracecapture/overview.md)** – Logic analyzer capture engine and device backends
- **[OpenTraceView](opentraceview/overview.md)** – Graphical user interface for visualizing signals
- **[OpenTraceDecode](opentracedecode/overview.md)** – Protocol decoders for analyzing captured data
## Quick Start
1. **[Install OpenTraceLab](get-started/install.md)** on your system
2. **[Capture your first trace](get-started/capture-first-trace.md)** with a logic analyzer
3. **[Explore protocol decoders](opentracedecode/overview.md)** to analyze your data
## Use Cases
OpenTraceLab supports a wide range of signal analysis applications:
- **Digital signal analysis** with logic analyzers
- **Protocol debugging** for I2C, SPI, UART, and 100+ other protocols
- **Embedded system development** and reverse engineering
- **Hardware validation** and testing
